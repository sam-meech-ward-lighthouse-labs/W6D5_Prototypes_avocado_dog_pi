# [[Prototype]]

**How does property lookup work in JavaScript?**

classes don't exist in JavaScript, they are syntactic sugar.  

It's just objects linked to other objects.

* [[Prototype]] is an object's prototype.
* __proto__ is a way of accessing an object's [[Prototype]]
* `.prototype` is a property that exists on all functions. It is not that function's [[Prototype]].
